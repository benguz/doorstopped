            <br>
            <div class="warning-box">

              <div>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Great teachers use Dominance for good&mdash;they keep rowdy classes on track without putting anyone down, they build close relationships with students through behavioral psychology&mdash;our goal is not to expose them. We&rsquo;re to expose teachers who <em>misuse</em> these strategies to make students uncomfortable, unsafe, and deeply unhappy&hellip; and show students how they can respond.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Not sure if your teacher fits? Find out <a href="/doorstops/care">here</a>. Have an issue with a nice teacher? <a href="/doorstops/hard">Try this</a>.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
<p>In 1993, when <a href="/school/selfie">zero-tolerance discipline policies</a> nationwide were getting students suspended for &ldquo;insubordination,&rdquo; education researchers decided the key to reducing &ldquo;behavior issues&rdquo; in classrooms was <strong>Dominance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Understand how your teacher sees you üëáüëá</strong></p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t mean stand-on-your-neck dominance or spank-your-bum dominance: they defined it as &ldquo;the teacher's ability to provide clear purpose and strong guidance regarding both academics and student behavior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That means rewards, punishments, and rules&mdash;plus hidden tactics to earn your trust or keep you stuck at your desk:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/dominance/policies.png" width="700px" style="max-width: 98%; margin: auto; border: 2px dashed sandybrown;" height="auto">
<p>EMPLOYING &ldquo;GROUP CONTINGENCY POLICIES,&rdquo; THAT&rsquo;S A NICE WAY OF SAYING <strong>COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT</strong>, WHICH IS A <strong>WAR CRIME</strong> UNDER THE GENEVA CONVENTION.</p>
<p>This was published in 2003 as the gold standard of teaching... </p>
<!-- <p>Spanking kids was only banned in the 80s (and only in 2009 in Ohio), meaning your older teachers might&rsquo;ve been <em>told </em>that spanking was OK when they started teaching. In the 90s, everybody thought curriculum (what to teach) was the hard part, and how to teach was easy. They were wrong.&nbsp;</p> -->
<p>Not every idea was bad, even if one of them is the *sole reason* your teachers are always making eye contact with you:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/dominance/contact.png" width="700px" style="max-width: 98%; margin: auto; border: 2px dashed sandybrown;" height="auto">
<p>Dominance enables teachers to abuse their power as the classroom boss, with an arsenal of small physical cues, barely acknowledging you when they put a finger on their lip or raise an eyebrow at you, creating routines and patterns, training you to behave. <strong>The root of dominance is fear.</strong> Your teacher can write home, suspend you, make you sit outside... kindergarten stuff.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/dominance/reactions.png" width="700px" style="max-width: 98%; margin: auto; border: 2px dashed sandybrown;" height="auto">
<p>Dominance makes it <em>seem</em> like there's nothing you can do about your teacher's power.</p>
<p>It almost feels like you have to act up just to show how you feel. </p>

<p><strong>1. Understand how your teacher sees you ‚úÖ</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Tag yourself üëáüëá</strong></p>
