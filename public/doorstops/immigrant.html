     ##### Too much pressure.

    ## I WANT TO WRITE A VERSION OF THIS IN RUSSIAN AND CHINESE 

    # You have untapped potential to help your children succeed in schools. 

    # School was different back home. This letter will explain what instincts you should take with you
    # and what to leave behind, with evidence from dozens of research studies. Each study involved listening 
    # to immigrant parents, understanding how they participate in education, and seeing how their kids did in school.

    # 1. Your opinion matters. 
    Don't be afraid that your English fluency, . You don't need to 100% understand US education to contribute.

    Action steps:


    # 2. Expectations help, pressure hurts.
    Across 75 studies, students with involved parents performed better. High expectations and more encouragement
    led to better grades and test scores.

    High pressure from parents *hurt* grades and test scores. 

    We apply pressure because we want them to succeed, but also because we're anxious and want to help. Using
    this toolkit of proven strategies will increase success and give us constructive outlets for our anxiety.

    Action steps:

    # 3. How was school?
    Communication is the final factor that *always* improves student achievement.

    Action steps:


    # Thank you for reading - please reach out with questions, concerns, or to learn more!

    # Students with parental involvement perform WAY better, but students with parental pressure perform worse

    Parental involvement variables that show promises
according to their correlations with academic achievement are: (a) reading at home, (b)
parents that are holding high expectations/aspirations for their children’s academic
achievement and schooling, (c) communication between parents and children regarding
school, (d) parental encouragement and support for learning. 

Expectations help, pressure hurts.

    Misunderstood/grossly wrong understanding of college process/prestige
    ## True Prestige
    If you want to be a Dr., only GPA and MCAT matters - better to go to a less competitive school.

    # There are different types of schools
    The top 20 schools on US News and World Report *are* the best 20 schools, but they have strengths and weaknesses.

    An appointment at any of the top 50 schools is incredibly prestiguous for a PROFESSOR, meaning you
    will find great professors at all of those schools. Again, at any of those schools, students will
    be able to build relationships with these professors and do research with them.

    What's that great marine biology school?


    # What makes a school Good?


    # Getting into a good school *isn't* about getting the perfect GPA.
    # The college process is a MAZE. Your intuition might be wrong here. Testimony from Allison hartley
    on parent expectations on essay editing.
