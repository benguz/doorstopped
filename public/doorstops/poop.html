    <p>This will make it clear that <strong>most of the school is against vaping.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Next: when someone leaves class to go to the bathroom, ask them, &ldquo;Hey, are you going to vape?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ask everyone. Even people who are obviously just going to the bathroom. When they get back, say, &ldquo;Gone a long time there buddy, what did you get up to in there?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Make it funny. Make it <em>so, so annoying</em>. Get people in all different friend groups to do it. This is <em>funny shaming</em>. You&rsquo;re not narking on anyone, you&rsquo;re not picking on anyone, you&rsquo;re not giving them a chance to talk back, but you&rsquo;re making it clearly lame to vape.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>If that doesn&rsquo;t work, negotiate</h3>
    <p>Ask the people who vape what sucks most about school. What would they be willing to give up vaping in exchange for?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Push past the non-answers like &ldquo;there&rsquo;s too much homework&rdquo; and &ldquo;let's make the school day shorter.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll probably hear an answer you agree with.</p>
    <p>Now you&rsquo;re 10x more likely to change whatever their problem is because you have <strong>negotiating leverage</strong>. The vapers have committed to stopping if the change is made, and admin does not want people vaping. Get it done.</p>

Hi [Teacher's Name],<br><br>

I frequently have to use the bathroom before our class and passing time isn't always enough time [optional: say why, like "because the only sanitary bathroom is on the other side of the building"].<br><br>

Would it be alright if I was a few minutes late to class sometimes? I'm happy to talk more about ways to make this work best for you.<br><br>

Thanks so much for understanding.

<br><br>Regards,<br>

Hi [Principal's Name],<br><br>

Many students have to use the bathroom during passing time, but [#]% don't have enough time according to a survey I ran [optional: say why, like "because there are long lines outside the bathrooms"].<br><br>

Would you be open to instituting a "passing pass" where students can arrive to class a minute or two late without receiving a tardy, maybe once a day?<br><br>

I'm happy to talk more about ways to make this work best and send you research on the long-term impacts of holding it in, as it's important to my health and the health of my peers.<br><br>

Hi [Principal‚Äôs name]<br><br>

[#]% of students I surveyed don't use the bathroom because there are no hygiene products there, and [#] bathrooms I inspected haven't had any for weeks. Please consider three possible solutions:<br>

- Pressing the district office for more funding (we're only talking $200-300 dollars to mitigate what's becoming a long-term health risk)<br>
- Partnering with custodians to regularly check and refill bathrooms<br>
- Allowing students to submit work orders when they need more hygiene products<br>
<br>
You do so much to keep this school running, and I know school bathrooms aren‚Äôt your top priority. It‚Äôs an important issue for me (lots of students don't use the bathrooms all day here!) and I want to start pressing for change.<br><br> 

Your support would be invaluable - are you free to talk about this?<br><br>

With hope and gratitude,<br>

Hi [Principal‚Äôs name]<br><br>

You do so much to keep this school running, and I know school bathrooms aren‚Äôt your top priority. It‚Äôs an important issue for me (lots of students hold in their poops at school!) and I want to start pressing for change.<br><br> 

Over the next couple of weeks, I will:</p>
<ol class=‚Äúreformat‚Äù>
<li class="honk"><p>Collect survey data from students on their bathroom experiences</p></li>
<li class="honk"><p>Take detailed inventory of issues in our bathrooms (which stall doors are broken, what smells bad)</p></li>
<li class="honk"><p>Listen to teachers, students, custodians, and the district building manager about feasible solutions</p></li>
<li class="honk"><p>Suggest a one-page restroom improvement plan to you outlining finances and sustainability</p></li>
</ol><p><br>
Would you be open to me pursuing this? I will handle all the work outlined above, but your support would be invaluable.<br><br>

With hope and gratitude,<br>

Hi [District Building Manager Name]<br><br>

I've surveyed [#] students on our bathroom conditions and [Y]% said they don't go to the bathroom when they have to at school because of bad conditions.<br><br>

Would you be open to talking about ways space can be made in the school budget to improve this? I'm free after school on [list days/times you're free, eg "Mondays and Wednesdays until 5pm and Fridays 1-3pm"].<br><br>

<p><strong>If admin doesn't think it's important:</strong> Collect data. IG poll your followers a simple question: "Do you poop in school?" High numbers are your evidence. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07435584221139342">Cite studies</a> that show the negative health effects of gross bathrooms.</p>
<p><strong>If admin says they don't have the money:</strong> go directly to the source, plumbers.</p>
<p>Email local plumbers asking for them to come fix up the bathroom for free in exchange for...</p>
<ul class="badonk">
  <li class="honk">Flyers sent home with every student advertising their service.</li>
  <li class="honk">Banners advertising them at sports events.</li>
</ul>
<p>This agreement <em>has</em> to be informal because the school can't approve that type of quid pro quo. Meaning you'll have to get those flyers into everyones' backpacks yourself. It will also help to <em>make friends with your custodians,</em> because at the end of the day they're the only people who have to be involved. Admin has their own bathrooms, they'll honestly never know if someone came in and repaired the student ones. Custodians have seen the bathrooms you have to use and will (hopefully) support you, as long as you're not asking the plumber to tear up the whole floor.</p>
<p><strong>If admin think students are the problem</strong>, and that people are always going to graffiti/smoke/start fires in the bathroom, ask them if they've ever seen drug deals happen in the Ralph Lauren store bathrooms.</p>
<p>Wait. Don't use those words. </p>
<p>Express that people don't respect the space right now because the space doesn't respect them. Nice bathrooms will change how students act in them. For evidence, ask them if they've ever been at a school that upgraded or renovated to a new building - did the graffiti and vandalism stop? Their answer will <em>probably</em> be yes - it's definitely what we've heard from teachers!</p>

maybe a rapper

I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT: "In another case, Project CLEAN wrote a `user standard‚Äô for schools based on the
belief that students should be seen more as citizens and not have restroom regulations
based so often on the disruptive action of a few"



"The leading school building administrator must be behind restroom improvement
to initiate such an effort, yet paradoxically he or she must engender a team of students,
other administrators, a few teachers and custodian and even parents, plus get district
support for a project to work"

"Too often when there is a problem,
for example with cigarette smoking in a high school, the chief administrator ‚Äúsolves‚Äù that
issue by locking the restroom doors, thus creating a host of other issues." - tell the Aaron story

" All too often disgruntled custodians leave graffiti
up for days, even weeks."

"Most regular subject teachers not
only refuse to monitor, let alone use school restrooms, but they also do not try to connect
their subject with restroom issues and etiquette."

<!-- "but people smoke and fuck in the bathrooms" - they don't respect the space bc the space doesn't respect them. When a district upgrades to a new school building, the graffiti/vandalism problems of the old, dilapidated school stop. Fast. -->

<!-- When you used the bathroom yesterday at school, did you have soap, tissues, and towels? -->
