    <p>
      If you want a teacher to give you an extension on an assignment, theyâ€™ll be fine with that. It gives them more time to grade and it doesnâ€™t cause any trouble.</p>
    
<p>      
  If you ask a teacher for something that <em>will</em> take up their time/energy, you need to pitch yourself and your idea. Usually all you have to bring to the table is proof you care, but sometimes you'll have to do something small in exchangeâ€”not, like, buying them an expensive watch. Donâ€™t bribe your teacher.</p>
  <p>
    Here are some good (and bad) options.</p>

          <p>While you're talking, notice differences between the teacher's goals and the reality. Point it out, but indirectly: ask questions, don't make claims. Example:</p>

            <div>
              <p><strong>Scenario: nobody has any idea what's going on in chemistry class but the teacher won't explain the content, answering with sarcasm when students ask specific questions: "Figure it out ya'self!"</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You:</strong> So what I'm hearing is usually students do better in your class when they get more independent work time, but this year it hasn't been working, even when students use independent time productively?</p>
              <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Yes, but it's not just that students are being productive, it's that they're asking really basic questions they should've learned about last year.</p>
              <p><strong>You:</strong> That's frustrating, yeah. The chem teacher last year was on maternitiy leave a good chunk of last year so we had a sub. Can you say more about the basic questions?</p>
              <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> It's so simple that students should be able to figure it out themselves, I'm kind of shocked they're even asking. The answers are usually on the first page of the textbook chapter.</p>
              <p><strong>You:</strong> So students have been asking these simple questions, and this has been going on for a month now without improvement, which must be aggravating because you said independent learning ability is one of your goals for the class, right?</p>
              <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Yes, maybe my approach isn't working, but it's worked so well in past years... [teacher continues, speculating about differences between these students and past students].</p>
              <p><strong>You:</strong> In the past, when students have responded differently to your material, have you tried making small changes to your approach?</p>
              <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> With some hit-or-miss success, but yes, it might be worth trying something different.</p>

              <ul class="badonk">
                <li class="honk"><p>Have you considered coming back to group discussion when a lot of students seem confused?</p></li>
                <li class="honk"><p>Have you considered creating worksheets that structure our work time so students can ease into reaching your goal of improving independent workiing ability?</p></li>
                <li class="honk"><p>What about rewarding students more for the things they're doing well already, like working productively and asking for help when they get stuck? Maybe you could encourage their questions more - they are the same as past students, they might just need a little support.</p></li>

<p>A lot of these scenarios force you to balance <strong>listening patiently</strong> and <strong>firmly asserting yourself</strong>. That can feel... hard. But we promise it's like riding a bike: once you practice a couple times (maybe play a few of these scenarios out with friends, or try the <a href="/programs/waffle">waffle game!</a>) it'll be so, so natural :)</p>
