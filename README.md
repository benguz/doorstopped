# Forking this repository to create a personalized page for a school
Doorstop Education

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add the github to netlify and add your chosen subdomain (eg. whs.doorstopped.org) to all custom domains (eg. whs.doorstopeducation.org).
3. Upload a logo to /assets/images/ and name it doors.svg, optionally adding a white version named doors-white.svg.
4. For all "form" Doorstops, add the specific contact point for your school.
5. Create another site on plausible, along with a new API key, adding the .env key locally and in Netlify
6. Choose which Doorstop categories you would like to use and create any school-specific ones
7. Change /index to some other content, or make the main landing page the student-facing one currently at /student.
8. Share your subdomain link with students. Go to /analytics on the live site to see how students are interacting with Doorstops!
9. Sync changes from the main fork often, as that is where new Doorstops will be added!
